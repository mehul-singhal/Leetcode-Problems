Intuition

The intuition behind this code is to keep track of the minimum price seen so far and the maximum profit that can be made by buying at 
the minimum price and selling at a higher price in the future.

Approach

The function maxProfit takes an input list prices which contains the stock prices for each day. 
It returns the maximum profit that can be obtained by buying and selling the stock once.

Here's how the code works:

It initializes minPrice to infinity and maxProfit to zero. These variables will be used to keep track of the minimum price seen so far and the maximum profit that can be obtained by selling at the current price.

The code then iterates through the prices list. For each price in the list:

a. If the price is less than minPrice, update minPrice to price. This is because we are looking for the minimum price to buy the stock.

b. Else, if the difference between the price and minPrice is greater than maxProfit, update maxProfit to the difference. This is because we are looking for the maximum profit that can be obtained by selling the stock at the price.

Finally, return maxProfit.

Complexity

Time complexity:
O(N)

Space complexity:
O(1)

Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the prices list. This is because the code iterates through the prices list once.

Space complexity: O(1). The code uses only two variables minPrice and maxProfit to keep track of the minimum price seen so far and the maximum profit that can be obtained, respectively. 
The space used by these variables is constant and does not depend on the size of the input.
